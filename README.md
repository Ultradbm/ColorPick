# ColorPick
Color Picker made in C# Windows Forms
</br>

To do: </br>
-Color picker needs anti aliasing - Look into Layered Windows or switch to WPF entirely for more effects and control. </br>
Look into WinUI and UWP also.</br>
-It may be preferable to take a screenshot of the screen and colorpick from that instead. We could then have the colorpicker cover the point it is picking from as it does in most art applications. I think this might need additional work to support multiple monitors.</br>
-Add drag and drop with smooth animations to the color palette. 
-Functionality to edit/make colors within the app on top of being able to pick colors from the screen.
